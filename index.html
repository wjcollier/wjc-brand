          <h3>CHEF</h3>
          <p>
            First and foremost I'm a craftsman & a cook. <br />
            My role as a chef encompasses not only the ability to create amazing
            food but organize every aspect of kitchen production, inventory
            control, menu engineering, recipe development, costing, monitor
            safety and hygiene standards, scheduling, interviewing, coordination
            with service teams as well as training of menus and techniques.
            These are the basics for the kitchen side. I will be happy to go
            into more detail in person.
            <br />
            <br />
            Being passionate about food, technique, history and the pursuit of
            perfection is an endless chase. My strongest foundations are
            Italian, the Mediterranean in general, France, Japan, SE Asian
            cuisines, and live-fire cooking from America-Europe-South America.
            <br />
            <br />
            I also have a deep understanding of the business side of an
            operation as an owner/operator myself. Involvement in marketing,
            social media, technology based systems, branding, design, and
            point-of-sales are a few are just a few key area's of my strengths.
            <br />

          <h3>F & B DIRECTOR</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to my Executive Chef roles over the years I have doubled
            as an F&B Director in mostly resort capacities. This includes the
            overall planning, management and operation of all outlets and
            restaurants. Overseeing the development and implementation of all
            menus, promotional strategies, sourcing of materials and equipment,
            budgeting for each department, Being highly visible to guests.
            Negotiate contracts with suppliers. The ability to plan, coordinate
            and execute events for thousands of guests. Marketing, tracking and
            analyzing f&b sales. <br />
            <br />
            Strong leadership and interpersonal skills are a must. Motivating
            the teams to think as one unit with identical goals. Highly detail
            oriented especially for alignment of branding guidelines.
            <br />
            <br />
            Lastly a key area is to be well informed on trends throughout the
            industry. It's a great benefit to know your farmers, brewers, wine
            makers, artisanal to organic. The most important fundamental is to
            start with best possible ingredients you can find.

          <h3>FREELANCE</h3>
          <p>
            As a freelance consultant I've had the opportunity to help
            businesses find their way. an F&b operation large or small is
            overwhelming especially for the unseasoned. you need an expert guide
            into the belly of the beast. defining a concept is the easy part,
            but putting the thousands of pieces together is a process and a
            formula. Every detail matters and the order of assembly is vital for
            success.
            <br />
            Whether launching a new venture or updating an existing restaurant,
            hotel or resort I bring all the skills I have honed over the years
            as a chef, director, owner to the table.
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm well seasoned in the cuisines from France, Italy, Vietnam,
            Thailand, Java, Bali, and the many subcultures of modern American
            cuisine from Southern BBQ to Californian farm-to-table, and the
            eclectic tasting menu experiences from NYC to LA.
            <br />
            Finally, embrace technology to keep you more efficient and
            consistent and spend the most important of your time in the kitchens
            and with your guests. I develop apps to help chefs and management
            have all they need at their fingertips.

              "Tony dropped on my radar back in the days when I worked in SF for
              Splendido. I'm not exactly sure how it happened, but I ended up
              picking up his 'expos√©' and polished it off the same day. Many
              years earlier, when I was working at the supper club for Wayne
              Nish on Broadway in NYC at the newly renovated Edison Theater, I
              was a sous chef at only 20 years old. I was the youngest in the
              entire building by far. Needless to say, I was in over my head and
              needed to move on to something to develop my skill set.
            </p>
            <p>
              I bumped into Tony afterwards as he had taken over the club since
              we all moved on. It was a great moment in time before he became
              the legend we all know and love. His awkwardness was his magnet.
              All I could think about is that FINALLY the truth was out about
              our industry. The glossy front pages of all the top chefs told one
              story, but in reality, it was the band of misfits behind the
              scenes that paid in blood for those success stories and adulation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Times have changed since then, but Tony was the voice of every
              cook in every dreary city's basement cave-like kitchen, grinding
              for survival on a pittance of their true value in hopes of being
              the next lucky one.

              I remember my 1st trip to Napa and dining at The French Laundry. I
              was a sous chef at the time for Elka Gilmore's Liberte in SF.
              There was nothing like it in the states at the time, at least for
              me. Most would surely see the obvious in the executed perfection,
              the tongue-in-cheek cleverness, the level of thought behind every
              detail.
            </p>

            <p>
              We shook hands by the exit, and I was actually quite speechless
              about the past 20 courses to put any sense words forward. He
              studied my battle-scarred hands and arms and knew I was in the
              trenches. He smiled, knowing I had seen the light; no words were
              necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was staying at a B&B close by, and the following day, a wicked
              storm rolled through, and I was trapped. I received a note from
              none other than TK himself inviting me back that night. 20 courses
              of a completely different menu. I'm not worthy, I thought. What a
              legend.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had a new purpose from that point forward. I was in my early 20s
              and was ready for the pursuit. What no one tells you, absolutely
              no one ever, is how demanding and painful the ride is going to be
              and the price to pay to be at that level.

              Fast forward a few years down the road, married and with a young
              one on the way, living in Santa Cruz, working in the garden every
              morning, appreciating the hard work of the organic everyday
              farmer. I took a position at this amazing institution back over
              the Santa Cruz mountains in Saratoga. I really didn't know the
              classics as much as I thought I did, but while adjusting, I was
              allowed and encouraged to experiment and bring a modern approach
              into the kitchen to complement dishes like steak au poivre,
              coulibiac, traditional caviar service, and so on.

              The day I discovered Ferran Adria and El Bulli forever changed
              everything for me on how to look at food. I remember early on when
              discussing or reading opinions from colleagues describing this
              movement as NOT food, I completely disavowed them. Well, not
              really, but for argument's sake, this was a wake-up call and a
              revolution for us all to think forward and take risks.
            </p>

            <p>
              Many years of going down rabbit holes in those days where the
              internet was a fairly new tool, collecting info was a tedious
              process. Virtually everything in our modern-day restaurants, this
              legend has had a hand in transforming expectations. The reluctance
              from the old guard to embrace this surreal presence in a world
              uncomfortable with change and the bottom-dollar thinkers and
              maniacal spreadsheet warriors that keep creativity in check have
              kicked and screamed their way to acceptance.
            </p>

            <p>
              I see Ferran Adri√† as our catalyst to becoming free in our limited
              small world of food creatives. Look around, it's now all you see.
              There are now many like him, and deservedly so, for their
              dedication, tireless unbound work, and determination. As far as
              I'm concerned, he's the OG that gave us all permission to dream.
              coincidentally, after 3 years of finding my voice and developing
              my craft this led to my 1st chef and co-owner position of
              231Ellsworth. keep dreaming you awakening wonders...
